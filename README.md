A gatsby starter made with love with all the features you'll ever need.

## Note

Initially I've made this starter as a boilerplate for my gatsby sites. As I progress, I've thought of making it open-sourced to help other developers, who may want the same setup that I have, to get up and running in no time.

The [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/) would be a great starter, if you would like a more plain and customizable starter.

I've also got some ideas from [Tania Rascia's Persnal Website](https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com/), which is also a very great gatsby theme and blog.
