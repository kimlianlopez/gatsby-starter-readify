The next battle may be over presidential war powers.



House members plan to vote on Thursday to force President Trump to quickly wind down military action against Iran unless he is given explicit authorization from Congress, said Speaker Nancy Pelosi.



Ms. Pelosi made the  announcement as lawmakers breathed a sigh of relief on Capitol Hill after Mr. Trump announced he would back away from any military escalation against Tehran.



But congressional Democrats, skeptical of the administration’s case for the drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, said they would press ahead with  efforts to rein in the president’s war-making authority.



They said they would move  forward with a measure that would require that Mr. Trump cease all military action against Iran within 30 days unless Congress votes to approve it.
